# DesignPatterns
Going to practice design patterns and C++ by implementing one design pattern a day-ish during the summer.

Based on these tutorials by [CppNuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyNWEWUSa5E&list=PLk6CEY9XxSIDZhQURp6d8Sgp-A0yKKDKV),  [Derek Bana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHpsC5ng_E) and https://sourcemaking.com/
